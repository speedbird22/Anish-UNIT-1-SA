### 🌍 The Problem We're Solving

> **India generates 62 million tonnes of waste every year.**  
> Only **25%** is properly segregated. The rest ends up in landfills, polluting soil, water, and air.

#### Who's Getting Affected?
- **Ragpickers & Sanitation Workers**: Exposed to hazardous waste daily  
- **Street Animals**: Ingest plastic & die painfully  
- **Our Rivers & Oceans**: Choked with non-segregated trash  
- **Future Generations**: Inheriting a toxic planet  

> **70% of waste segregation fails because people don’t know WHERE to throw WHAT.**
